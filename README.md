# Fibonacci

#### Overview

Files included:

- FibMemoization.java
- FibAlgorithms.java
- AnalyzeAndOutput.java

#### Compilation and Running

To execute the programs and generate the text file and graph, compile all three java programs and then run the main method in AnalyzeAndOutput.

#### FibMemoization.java

FibMemoization.java contains the implementation of a memory optimized verison of the recursive algorithm to solve the Fibonacci problem. The FibMemoization class contains two methods, an imlementation of the algorithm (fibMemoization) and a main method to test some inputs.

#### FibAlgorithms.java

FibAlgorithms.java contains the implementations of Fib1, Fib2, and Fib3 algorithms for part 2 of the assignment. This class only contains the implementations, and no tests to run the code.

#### AnalyzeAndOutput.java

AnalyzeAndOutput.java contains code to run Fib1, Fib2, and Fib3, and produce the output file and graph used to analyze the efficiency and runtimes of the three different implementations of algorithms to solve the Fibonacci problem.
